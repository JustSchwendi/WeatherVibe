# WeatherVibe — Speed Vibecoding Contest Entry 🔥

**Developer:** Christian “JustSchwendi” Schwendemann  
**Type:** Interactive weather-vibe demo / creative coding experiment  
**Contest:** Speed Vibecoding (time-boxed coding challenge)

## 🎯 What is WeatherVibe?

WeatherVibe is my entry into a **speed vibecoding** contest — a live challenge to build a visual, interactive experience under tight time constraints. The concept: combine real-time weather data with vibey visual/sonic feedback loops to evoke a sensory “vibe” tied to ambient conditions.

It’s not just about showing temperature or humidity — it’s about *feeling* weather through code.

## 🧠 Motivation & Contest Context

- **Speed Vibecoding**: I had limited time (e.g. 1–2 hours) to ideate, code, and polish — testing creativity, speed, and fluency in web & visual programming.  
- The goal was to build something expressive, technical, and shareable — not a full product, but a statement of style, skill, and real-time data play.  
- Projects like this help me experiment with **data visualization**, **client-side real-time updates**, and **ambient UX** in the SaaS + observability realm.

## 🚀 Tech Stack & Architecture

- **Frontend:** HTML / CSS / JavaScript — lightweight, responsive, browser-native.  
- **Data Source:** Real-time (or near real-time) weather APIs (e.g. OpenWeatherMap, etc.).  
- **Rendering / Effects:** Visual/vibe layers based on conditions (temperature, wind, cloudiness).  
- **Interactivity:** Responsive updates, transitions, animations.  
- **Goal:** Minimal dependencies, maximum expressivity under pressure.

## 📈 Features & Highlights

- Automatic ambient visuals that *react* to weather conditions (e.g. cloud cover, wind, rain).  
- Smooth transitions between states (sunny → overcast → stormy).  
- Creative mapping: we turn numeric weather metrics into mood/vibe signals.  
- Contest-driven constraints: limited time, minimum viable UX, code elegance.

## 🔍 Why Explore This Repo?

- **Creative Playground:** Peek into the thought process behind expressive code under constraints.  
- **Data → Aesthetic Bridge:** See how raw weather data can be turned into emotive visuals.  
- **Inspiration:** Fork or remix for ambient dashboards, IoT visuals, weather-driven art.  
- **Showcase:** Demonstrates agility in front-end development, real-time data handling, and visual thinking.
